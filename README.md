# Brain Tumor Survival Prediction

This project aims to build a classification model that predicts the survival chances (High or Low) of patients based on the type of brain tumor.

## Project Overview

The goal is to use machine learning techniques to assist in medical prognosis by analyzing data related to brain tumors and predicting patient outcomes.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

##  How It Works

1. Data preprocessing and exploration
2. Feature selection and model training
3. Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.
4. Final model predicts survival chances: High or Low.
